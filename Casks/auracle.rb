  # The bare symbol, not the comparison-string form. For a cask a symbol already
  # means "this version or newer" — brew info renders it as macOS >= 14 either
  # way — but RuboCop's Homebrew/OSDependsOn rejects the string, and brew style
  # is a hard gate in the publish job. The string sat here unnoticed because that
  # job runs only on publish=true, which nothing used until 0.1.3.
